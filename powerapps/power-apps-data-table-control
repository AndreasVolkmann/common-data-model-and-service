# Data table control in PowerApps

A control that shows a set of data in a tabular format. 

## Description
The Data table control allows you to display a dataset in a tabular format, which includes column headers for each field visualized. You, as the maker, have full control over the fields you want to show from the data source as well as the order in which those fields appear.  The Data table control maintains a Selected property that, like the Gallery, points to the single row that is currently selected, which can be used to link the Data table to other controls.  

## Key properties
**Items** – The source of data that appears in the control
