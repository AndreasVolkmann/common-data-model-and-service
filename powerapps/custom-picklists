# Create custom picklists
It is now possible to create your own picklists, in addition to the ones that are available out of the box. As you may know, picklists are really a simple concept, basically a named list of items with a name and a description; they are mainly used as types of fields. When such fields are rendered, a dropdown box with the display names of the items will appear. 
Picklists are added by using the menu item called Picklists in the “Common Data Service” tab, right under the entities menu. Clicking that menu brings you to a page showing all the picklists that are currently defined in your environment. A lot of commonly used picklists are already defined for you out of the box; those can easily be identified by the fact that their type is “Standard”. The ones you create for yourself are of type “Custom”.
