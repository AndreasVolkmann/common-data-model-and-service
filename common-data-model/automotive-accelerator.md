[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

With the [Dynamics 365 Automotive Accelerator](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365/msauto.msftautomotivecommondatamodel?tab=Overview), you can develop solutions based on entities and attributes that dealeaships and OEMs commonly leverage for customer experience and other business processes. These entities include deals, sales contracts, specifications, fleet, warranties, inspection, test drives, branding, business, customer-vehicle relationship, vehicle and equipment, lead, service and after-sales management, and more. The accelerator includes a automotive data model, PowerBI apps, canvas and model-driven sample apps based on connected experiences.

The automotive accelerator provides the following to both partners and customers:

-   Extensions to the Common Data Model to include a data model to support DMS, including entity definitions and relationships.
-	Sample model-driven apps to show some possibilities of how Dynamics 365 and the banking data model can be used including customer engagement, know your customer (KYC), referral sharing, and onboarding.
-	Sample canvas apps for the Relationship Manger to quickly see appointments and create referrals to show how anyone can quickly develop new apps with the Power Platform using the Banking Accelerator.
-	Sample Power BI dashboards that provide analytics around loans, applications, referrals, and the bank's customers, with drill downs into Retail, Commercial, or see unified visuals and dashboard spanning both lines of business.
-	Sample file to implement the banking data model in Azure Data Lake Storage for analytics, AI, and Machine Learning.
-	Individual solutions for retail and commercial banking and a package that you can deploy and install including sample data. 
-	Test drive experience through AppSource with walkthroughs, reference guides, entity-relationship diagrams and metadata documentation on the data model.

With the Dynamics 365 Banking Accelerator, you can optimize the customer experience, improve collaboration within the bank, and gain insights from analytics. When the accelerator is installed into Dynamics 365, the experience is transformed into one specifically built for banks and it allows institutions to quickly build PowerApps and Power BI visualizations.

Banks, ISVs, and others in Financial Services can build their solutions and business processes on top of the new entities found within the Banking Accelerator. The current data model supports common banking activities but has been designed to allow flexibility for other use cases in Financial Services. The data model was developed in collaboration with [BIAN](https://www.bian.org/) and other open API initiatives to ensure interoperability to help unlock new Open Banking opportunities.
