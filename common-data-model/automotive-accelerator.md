# The Dynamics 365 Automotive Accelerator

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

With the [Dynamics 365 Automotive Accelerator](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365/msauto.msftautomotivecommondatamodel?tab=Overview), you can develop solutions based on entities and attributes that dealeaships and OEMs commonly leverage for customer experience and other business processes. These entities include deals, sales contracts, specifications, fleet, warranties, inspection, test drives, branding, business, customer-vehicle relationship, vehicle and equipment, lead, service and after-sales management, and more. The accelerator includes a automotive data model, PowerBI apps, canvas and model-driven sample apps based on connected experiences.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Automotive Accelerator is a preview feature.

The automotive accelerator provides the following to both partners and customers:

-   Extensions to the Common Data Model (CDM) to include a data model to support customer experiences, including entity definitions and relationships.
-	Sample model-driven apps to show some possibilities of how Dynamics 365 and the automotive data model can be used including customer experience management, customer 360, connected field service, and DMS.
-	Sample canvas apps for the Fleet Manager to quickly and pro-actively schedule service appointments with service centers to show how anyone can quickly develop new apps with the Power Platform using the Automotive Accelerator.
-	Sample Power BI dashboards that provide analytics around vehicle inventory, services, lead disposition, branding, and business operation. 
-	Sample "Model.json" file to implement the automotive data model as CDM Folders in Azure Data Lake Storage for analytics, AI, and Machine Learning.
-	Individual solutions for Sales, After Sales, Marketing and a package that you can deploy and install including sample data. The Automotive CDM extension can also be installed using a Power platform SKU. 
-	Test drive experience through AppSource with walkthroughs, reference guides, entity-relationship diagrams and metadata documentation on the data model.
