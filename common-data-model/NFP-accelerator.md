# The Dynamics 365 Nonprofit Accelerator

The Accelerator was announced at the initial Microsoft CXO Summit in [April 2018](https:/blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/11/08/new-dynamics-365-nonprofit-accelerator-supports-organizations-with-end-to-end-solutions/)
and released in [November 2018](https:/blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/11/08/new-dynamics-365-nonprofit-accelerator-supports-organizations-with-end-to-end-solutions/)
at the [NetHope Global Summit](https://youtu.be/eV4N0mK0-so?t=2169). The initial release includes the following features:

-   extension of the Common Data Model (CDM) to include concepts for constituent
    management, fundraising, grants/awards, program delivery and impact tracking
    including entity definitions and relationships

-   Individual, Household and Organization customer-engagement forms that you
    can enhance or use out of the box

-   a constituent management sample app that demonstrates some possibilities of
    the Unified Interface

-   support for building canvas and model-driven apps in PowerApps

-   support for extending the model with custom entities, forms, and
    relationships that meet your nonprofit needs

-   support for analytics

-   a Common Data Service for Apps solution that you can install from AppSource

-   Documentation that supports adoption of the Accelerator

**Site Map Extensions:**

With the Nonprofit Accelerator plugged in to the Dynamics 365 platform, you can
optimize individual aspects of nonprofit business processes including
fundraising, grant/award management, program delivery and impact tracking or
leverage the entire constituent-engagement solution within Dynamics 365.

This accelerator adds a nonprofit layer to the rich feature set of the base
Dynamics 365 functionality by adding nonprofit entities to record detailed
constituent profiles for individuals, households and organizations, the
end-to-end fundraising, grants/awards lifecycles and standards-based program
delivery and impact tracking based on the [IATI
standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/).
