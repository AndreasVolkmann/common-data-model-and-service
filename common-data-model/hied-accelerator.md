# The Dynamics 365 Higher-Education Accelerator

With the [Dynamics 365 Higher-Education
Accelerator](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mshied.highereducationcommondatamodel?tab=Overview),
you can develop solutions that are based on entities and attributes that
higher-education institutions use. The accelerator includes entities around
student engagement and additional entities around Internships, Scholarships,
Grants, and Accomplishments. The accelerator includes entities, fields, forms,
views, and dashboards.

The accelerator now includes the following features:

-   Extensions to the Common Data Model (CDM) to include concepts for higher
    education, including entity definitions and relationships

-   Student Portal where students can view courses events, and see history of
    courses and applications

-   Business Partner Dashboard provide any organization that is willing to
    engage with the university for events, hackathons, internships,
    scholarships, and grants.

-   Accomplishment captures any work completed by student outside of the course
    such as hackathons or awards

-   Grants Phone App allows research faculty to keep track of applications and
    approval of grants that they’ve applied to

-   All personas including students, business partners, and faculty members have
    access to rich reporting of students applying for internships, grants, and
    scholarships

-   System views that provide easy access to entities such as students, faculty,
    extracurricular activities, previous education, test scores, courses,
    academic periods, programs, test types, registration status, and areas of
    interest

-   Sample apps to show some possibilities of the Unified Interface

-   Example Dynamics 365 dashboards and a Power BI dashboards that provides
    analytics for completed courses and allows drilling into details about
    student performance, instructor effectiveness, and course feedback

-   Support for building additional canvas and model-driven apps in Power Apps

-   A solution that you can deploy and install from AppSource or GitHub

**Site-map extensions**

With the Dynamics 365 Higher-Education Accelerator, institutions can optimize
student and faculty engagement, improve institutional effectiveness, and predict
outcomes and gain insights from analytics. When the accelerator is installed
into Dynamics 365, the experience is transformed into one specifically built for
higher education and allows institutions to quickly build Power Apps and Power
BI visualizations.

Higher-education institutions can build their business processes on top of the
entities in the accelerator. The ribbon customizations contain entities to
record student, faculty, and alumni interactions, business partner interactions,
appointments, events, and outreach.

**Entities and workflows**

This accelerator provides these entities to support the needs of
higher-education institutions:

| Accounts                     | Course                    | Previous Education     | Student Program Type |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Contacts                     | Course History            | Program                | Student Status       |
| Academic Period              | Course Section            | Program Level          | Test Score           |
| Academic Period Detail       | Education Level           | Program Version        | Test Type            |
| Area of Interest             | Extra Curricular Activity | Program version Detail | Area of Study        |
| Extra Curricular Participant | Registration Status       | Internship             | Internship Applicant |
| Scholarship                  | Scholarship Applicant     | Grant                  | Grant Applicant      |
| Accomplishments              |                           |                        |                      |

**Forms and dashboards**

The Dynamics 365 Higher-Education Accelerator combines standard Dynamics 365
entities with customized entities to make it easier to build solutions. This
section describes some of the forms, views, and dashboards that demonstrate the
new entities and the data model.

**Business Partner Dashboard/Forms**

A business partner is any organization who is willing to engage with the
university for events, hackathons, internships, scholarships, and grants. With
the native dashboard and PowerBI dashboards, business partners gain insights on
student interest in opportunities and applications for grants and scholarships.

**Student Internship Application Status**

This form tracks the status of student’s internship application.

**Grants Phone App**

Research faculty can keep track of grant applications submitted by their
students, see example below:

**Student form**

This Dynamics 365 form shows student information (such as contact information,
course load, areas of study, degree, course history, test scores) in the context
of the app and the interface. The student record becomes the source of truth and
engagement to deliver the best support throughout the student lifecycle.

**Institutional dashboard**

This accelerator includes a student dashboard in Dynamics 365 and an
institutional dashboard in Power BI. With the institutional dashboard, you gain
analytics and insights into students, classes, and key metrics such as students
by program and demographics.
