# The Dynamics 365 Higher Education Accelerator

With the [Dynamics 365 Higher Education Accelerator](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mshied.highereducationcommondatamodel?tab=Overview), you can develop solutions for higher education using entities and attributes that institutions use; these entities include students, faculty, courses, test scores, and more. The solution includes entities, fields, forms, views, and dashboards.

The Higher Education Accelerator was ([announced in October 2018 at EDUCAUSE](https://educationblog.microsoft.com/2018/10/transforming-higher-education-to-address-the-skills-gap/)), and the initial release provides:
- extensions to the Common Data Model (CDM) to include concepts for higher education, including entity definitions and relationships 
- system views that provide easy access to entities such as students, faculty, extracurricular activities, previous education, test scores, courses, academic periods, programs, test types, registration status, and areas of interest
- Forms such as ones for student, faculty, and course history, which you can leverage or enhance for customer engagement
- an app to provide a sample of what's possible on the Unified Interface
- example Dynamics 365 dashboards and a Power BI dashboard, which provides analytics for completed courses and allows drilling into details on student performance, instructor effectiveness, and course feedback
- support for building additional canvas and model-driven apps in PowerApps
- a solution that you can deploy and install from AppSource or via GitHub

## Site-map extensions 
With the Higher Education Accelerator and Dynamics 365, institutions can optimize student and faculty engagement, improve institutional effectiveness, and have the analytics to predict outcomes and gain insights. When the Higher Education Accelerator is installed into Dynamics 365, it transforms the experience into one specifically built for higher education and allows institutions to quickly build PowerApps and Power BI visualizations. 

Higher education institutions can utilize the accelerator to build their business processes on top of the built-in entities. The ribbon customizations contain entities to record student, faculty, and alumni interactions, appointments, events, and outreach.  
               
## Entities & Workflows
The Higher Education Accelerator provides a specific set of entities to support the needs of institutions in higher education. The solution provides these entities.

| | | | |
| ------- | -----------------|------------------| ------------|
|Accounts	|Course	|Previous Education	|Student Program Type|
|Contacts	|Course History	|Program	|Student Status|
|Academic Period	|Course Section	|Program Level	|Test Score|
|Academic Period Detail	|Education Level	|Program Version	|Test Type|
|Area of Interest	|Extra Curricular Activity|	Program version Detail	|Area of Study|
|Extra Curricular Participant	|Registration Status	|

## Included forms and dashboards
The Dynamics 365 Higher Education Accelerator combines built-in Dynamics 365 entities with customized entities to make it easier to build new solutions. This section describes some of the forms, views, and dashboards that demonstrate the new entities and the data model. 

### Student form
The student form allows you to see a student 360 form and view it in Dynamics 365. The form shows contact information, course load, areas of study, degree, course history, test scores, and more: all in the context of the app and the interface. The student record becomes the source of truth and engagement to deliver the best support throughout the student lifecycle.

### Course-history form
The course-history form shows the course, the course section, the instructor, the credit, the grade, and more.

### Institutional dashboard
The Higher Education Accelerator includes a student dashboard in Dynamics 365 and an institutional dashboard in Power BI. With the institutional dashboard, you gain analytics and insights into students, classes, and key metrics such as students by program and demographics.
