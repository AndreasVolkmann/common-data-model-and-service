# Submitting Requests


In order to help us efficiently track partner requests and reported issues, please file all feature requests and bugs to the Common Data Model VSTS Project, under the <a href="https://commondatamodel.visualstudio.com/CDM/_workitems/recentlyupdated/">Work Items</a> section. 
For any bugs you encounter, please make sure to provide detailed explanation how to reproduce them, and ideally supported with a code sample.
