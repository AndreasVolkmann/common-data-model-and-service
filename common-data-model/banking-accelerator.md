# The Microsoft 365 Banking Accelerator (preview)

With the [Dynamics 365 Banking Accelerator](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-crm/msfsi.bankingcommondatamodel?tab=Overview), you can develop solutions based on entities and attributes that banks commonly leverage for customer experience and other business processes. These entities include banks, branches, financial products, loans, referrals, limits, facilities, and more. The accelerator includes a banking data model, sample apps, dashboards, and connected experiences for both Retail Banking and Commercial Banking.

This Banking Accelerator provides the following to both partners and customers:

- extensions to the Common Data Model (CDM) to include a data model to support banking, including entity definitions and relationships
-	sample model-driven apps to show some possibilities of how Dynamics 365 and the banking data model can be used including customer engagement, know your customer, referral sharing, and onboarding
-	sample canvas apps for the Relationship Manger to quickly see appointments and create referrals to show how anyone can quickly develop new apps with the Power Platform using the Banking Accelerator
-	example Power BI dashboards which provide analytics around loans, applications, referrals, and its customers, with drill downs into Retail, Commercial, or see unified visuals and dashboard spanning both lines of business
-	sample file to implement the banking data model in Azure Data Lake Storage for analytics, AI, and Machine Learning
-	individual solutions for retail and commercial banking and a package that you can deploy and install including sample data 
-	Test Drive experience through AppSource with walk-throughs, reference guides, ERDs, and metadata documentation on the data model


## Sitemap extensions

With the Dynamics 365 Banking Accelerator, you can optimize the customer experience, improve collaboration within the bank, and gain insights from analytics. When the accelerator is installed into Dynamics 365, the experience is transformed into one specifically built for banks and allows institutions to quickly build PowerApps and Power BI visualizations.

Banks, ISVs, and others in Financial Services can build their solutions and business processes on top of the new entities in the Banking Accelerator. The current data model supports common banking activities but has been designed to allow flexibility for other use cases in Financial Services. The data model was developed in collaboration with [BIAN](https://www.bian.org/) and Open Banking to ensure interoperability to help unlock new Open Banking initiatives.


## Entities and workflows

This accelerator provides support for the following and more to support the needs of banks and others in Financial Services:

| | | |
| ------- | -----------------|------------------|
|Companies |Financial Products |Banks |
|People |Commercial Loans |Branches |
|Prospects |Mortgages |Syndicates |
|Referrals |Home Equity  |Collateral |
|KYC |Checking Accounts | Limits |
|Opportunities |Deposit Accounts | Commercial Deals |

## Forms and dashboards

The Dynamics 365 Banking Accelerator can be used on the Power Platform or combined with standard Dynamics 365 entities to make it easier to build solutions. This section describes just a few of the forms, views, and dashboards that demonstrate how the Banking Accelerator extends CDM, the Power Platform, and Dynamics 365.

### Customer 360 form

This banking Customer 360 view shows everything about the person from their profit tier (segmentation), to interaction and activities, to KYC, what financial products they have, and who is within their household. The person (or company) record becomes the source of truth and engagement to deliver the best customer experience.

### Branch manager dashboard

Example dashboards both in Dynamics 365 and Power BI are included in the Banking Accelerator. With the example bank branch office dashboard, the bank branch manager gains analytics and insights into account applications, onboarding stage, referrals and prospects, and which products are most popular.
