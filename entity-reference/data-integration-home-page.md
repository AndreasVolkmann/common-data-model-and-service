# Data integration home page

In today’s world, applications are most useful and relevant to users when they can all act on the same data.  This is critical to ensure that every user is seeing the latest (and correct) data so that they can make the right decisions and take the appropriate actions as necessary. 

The Common Data Service makes it extremely simple for customers to bring their data together so all users and apps can act on that data.  The first feature in this space is the Prospect to Cash data integration which is currently in Preview.  To learn more about the Prospect to Cash feature, see [Dynamics 365 data integration](dynamics-365-integration.md).

The Dynamics 365 data integration feature enables the flow of data between Dynamics 365 for Sales, Dynamics 365 for Operations, and other products through Common Data Service. This feature enables a basic flow of accounts and other entity data to enable a prospect-to-cash scenario. This document describes the capabilities, usage guidelines, and current limitations of the Data Integration feature.

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Data Integration feature is available to customers who have at least one Dynamics 365 product. It enables the flow of data between Microsoft Dynamics products through Common Data Service (CDS). For example, customer information in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales can flow to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations. Users don’t have to manually move the data or use a third-party data integration tool.
