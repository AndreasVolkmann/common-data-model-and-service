# Standard entities

Out of the box, the CDM provides a set of entities that supports key scenarios. For example, the Employee, Contractor, and Company entities support employment scenarios. The PurchaseOrder and PurchaseOrderLine entities support purchasing scenarios. The entities are grouped by function – for example, sales, marketing, and productivity. The model is simpler and, at the same time, more consumable than the models in a full enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM) suite. This simplicity is reflected in the number of entities, the relational structure of those entities, and the number of fields in those entities. All entities have a standard set of fields that drive the core capabilities of the platform.

The entities are organized into five functional groups.

Functional Group	| Description

Foundation | The Foundation entities contain information that is relevant to nearly every other entity group. This group contains entities such as Address and Currency.
People, organizations, and groups |	These entities encompass a rich set of people and organizations that you might interact with, including employees, contractors, donors, volunteers, fans, alumni, and families.
