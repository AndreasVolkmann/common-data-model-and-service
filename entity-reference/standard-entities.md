# Standard entities

Out of the box, the common data model provides a set of entities that supports key scenarios. For example, the Worker, Employment, and Organization entities support employment scenarios. The PurchaseOrder and PurchaseOrderLine entities support purchasing scenarios. The entities are grouped by function â€“ for example, sales, purchasing, and productivity. The model is simpler and, at the same time, more consumable than the models in a full enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM) suite. This simplicity is reflected in the number of entities, the relational structure of those entities, and the number of fields in those entities. All entities have a standard set of fields that drive the core capabilities of the platform.

The entities are organized into these functional groups.

Functional Group	| Description
--- | ---
Customer service | The customer service entities manage issues from your customers, including tracking, escalation, and documentation.
Foundation | The Foundation entities contain information that is relevant to nearly every other entity group. This group contains entities such as Address and Currency.
Human resources | The human resources entities let you manage employment information, jobs, leaves, and positions.
Person, organization, and group |	These entities encompass a rich set of people and organizations that you might interact with, including workers, vendors, tenants, fans, alumni, and families.
Productivity | The productivity entities let you track events and messages.
Purchasing |The Purchasing entities let you create purchasing solutions.
Sales |The Sales entities let you create end-to-end sales solutions, from tracking leads and opportunities, to following through with contacts, to accepting and delivering orders, to sending invoices.
