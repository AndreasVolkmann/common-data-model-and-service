# Privacy notice
With the Microsoft PowerApps common data model we collect and store custom entity and field names in our diagnostic systems. We use this knowledge to improve the common data model for our customers. The entity and field names that Creators create help us understand scenarios that are common across the Microsoft PowerApps community and ascertain gaps in the serviceâ€™s standard entity coverage, such as schemas related to organizations. The data in the database tables associated with these entities is not accessed or used by Microsoft or replicated outside of the region in which the database is provisioned. Note, however, the custom entity and field names may be replicated across regions and are deleted in accordance with our data retention policies. Microsoft is committed to your privacy as described further in our [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/Privacy/default.aspx).
