# Common Data Service

The Common Data Service is the Microsoft Azure–based business application platform that enables customers to easily build and extend applications with their business data.  The Common Data Service does the heavy lifting of bringing together your data from across the Dynamics 365 family of services so you can focus on building and delivering the apps, insights and process automation that matter to you and your customers with PowerApps, Power BI and Microsoft Flow.   
 
The three pillars of the Common Data Service are: 

+ **Be the focal point for your data**: bring your data together into one place. 
+ **Be a great place to build and manage apps**: help app creators and developers of all skill levels to easily create apps with the data in the Common Data Service. 
+ **It just works with the rest of Microsoft**: provide out-of-the-box integrations with technologies across Microsoft including Flow, Power BI and Office.
