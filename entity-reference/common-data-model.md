# Common Data Model home page

The Common Data Model is a library of entities that represent the most commonly used entities across business and productivity applications. The library is organized for simplicity and rapid discoverability. Typical solutions will revolve around core elements of enterprise data â€“ for example, a worker, an account, a product, or a vendor. Applications across the enterprise will drive updates to that data. The Common Data Model is implemented to simplify the challenges of data management.
