# Entity Versioning

Entities created with the Common Data Model (version 0.1) will be not be supported when Common Data Model (version 1.0) is released. Schema compatibility between versions 0.1 and 1.0 is not guaranteed.

The Common Data Model (version 1.0) will provide versioning as entities change over time. Multiple versions of an entity will be supported at the same time, however, entity versions may be deprecated and removed over time with adequate notice and upgrade guidance.
