# Upgrade to Common Data Service for Apps

The previous version of Common Data Service was enhanced and released as **Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps** in March 2018 to offer significant new capabilities such as server-side logic, improved app-building experience, and a solid extensibility platform (based on the proven Dynamics 365 xRM platform) for developers and ISVs. More information: [New features in the Common Data Service for Apps and PowerApps Spring Update](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/cds-for-apps-march/).
