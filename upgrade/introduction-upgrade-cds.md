# Upgrade to Common Data Service for Apps

The previous version of Common Data Service was enhanced and released as Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps in March 2018 to offer significant new capabilities such as server-side logic, improved app-building experience, and a solid extensibility platform (based on the proven Dynamics 365 xRM platform) for developers and ISVs. More information: [New features in the Common Data Service for Apps and PowerApps Spring Update](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/cds-for-apps-march/).

1. Start upgrading your database to CDS for Apps 
2. Upgrade and verify your apps and flows with the new CDS for Apps database
