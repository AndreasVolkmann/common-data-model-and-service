# Microsoft Flows Maker: Upgrade flows to connect to upgraded database

As part of the upgrading the CDS database in your environment, the corresponding flows will also need to be upgraded. To make this process as seamless as possible, you will find that the affected flows have already been cloned and prefixed with the word "[Upgraded]"

In order to ensure that your flows are upgraded correctly, you will need to follow the following steps: 

Step 1: Navigate to the "Flow Portal" and select the environment, in which your CDS enviroment is being upgraded. 
Note: You should have received an email informing you of the flows that need attention. 

Step 2: Edit the "[Upgraded]" flow to ensure that the flow definition looks accurate and functionally similar to your existing flow.
Make the necessary changes, if needed to save your flow successfully. 

Step 3: Test and validate your flow. Ensure that your flow runs successfully and performs the functional tasks that you'd expect it to on a successful run. 

Step 4: Once the upgrade process has been completed, delete the old flows and if needed remove the [Upgraded] prefix from the new flow. 
Note: You will receive an email informing you that the upgrade process is complete.
